This project is a fork of this [work by fafalone (jon jonson)](https://github.com/fafalone/TBXLLUDF "work by fafalone (jon jonson)"). Jon has done a great job and provided a general understanding of how xll works for people who think in Basic. But given that the topic of xll and Excel API is quite extensive and not very well documented in places, there seems to be some scope for research. And this is interesting to some extent, since this topic is very poorly covered by VB-like languages, since, to some extent, you can feel like, not exactly a pioneer, but you can make some contribution. From now on, I'd better write in a language I understand, so as not to look so incomprehensible and strange.
